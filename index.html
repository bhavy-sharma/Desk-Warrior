I never thought she would accomplish so much, but hats off to her! Salute to the one who genuinely took responsibility for this entire project. And honestly, putting jokes aside, you won’t believe it, but I truly thought this project wouldn’t happen—because until March 11, no one was ready to work on it. But finally, with your hard work and the team's coordination, this project turned out to be a success. Keep it up!`)">

The way she managed the details and executed the design is truly commendable. Her contribution has added great value to the project, and she definitely deserves appreciation for it! And Aastha, you’ve built the page—no doubt about that—but I think one piece of advice might help you. Start everything from scratch once more. You’re learning new things, which is great, but learning alone isn’t enough—implementing what you’ve learned is just as important. So, keep going and keep improving. Keep it up!`)">
